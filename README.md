# Smart Connections
A small quality of life mod that makes connecting machines in Upload Labs faster and less annoying.

## What it does
In the base game you need to drag your wire all the way to the exact input or output slot on the target machine. This mod removes that precision requirement (no more moving around your screen to find the exact slot!).  
With Easy Connect, you only need to drag and drop the wire anywhere inside the machine. The mod automatically snaps the wire to the correct slot.

## How to use
1. Start dragging a connection like normal  
2. Drop it anywhere on the target machine  
3. The mod finds the proper slot and completes the connection for you  

That is it. Nothing new to configure.

## Compatibility
The mod does not change core systems and should work with most other mods that do not alter connection logic.

## Feedback
If you run into issues or have ideas to make this feature better, feel free to leave a comment on the Workshop page.

Enjoy building.
